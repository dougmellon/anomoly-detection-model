# Anomoly Detection with Autoencoders
The modeling procedure for the model development, assessment, and interpretation of the results:
- Model development
- Threshold determination
- Descriptive statistics of the normal and abnormal groups

With the outlier scores, you will choose a threshold to separate the abnormal observations with high outlier scores 
from normal observations. If any prior knowledge suggests the percentage of anomalies should be no more than 1%, we can
choose a threshold that results in approximately 1% of anomalies.
